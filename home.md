## About Me
<img src="IMG_1838.jpg" alt="Portrait of Talyn Fan" width="200"/>

I graduated from Emory University with a B.A. in English and Creative Writing and a minor in Computer Science in 2022. In both my artistic and technological pursuits, I aim to craft entertaining and meaningful experiences for my audiences.

## My design principles



### Joy

Enjoyment is very important to me. A product should be fun to use, beyond its utility value. Creativity and innovation is what makes humans superior over algorithms.

Include Argyle and video game design.

### Organization

I keep organized in my design process and take good notes of all iterations, from start to finish. In a team, I am typically the person to "take minutes" of what is accomplished each meeting or day.

Include log of daily activities for figma, in progress photos of sonus, really organized spreadsheet for Argyle

### Storytelling

A user's experience is like a crafted story. I like thinking about the psychology of design. Where people will look first, what draws attention. Guiding the linear narrative and storytelling. It’s what I do as a writer, what my training in Creative Writing and as an actor tells me. Be aware of the audience and how you can communicate clearly.

Examples include Argyle, Figma flow, storyboard, and video game design

### Low-fidelity prototyping

I love to sketch. Drawing and doodling helps me quickly understand what a technology will look like before it is even built. It is important to communicate the essence of an idea without needing it to function.

Include sonus sketch, storyboard, figma sketch

### Risk-taking

Not all of the things I do work. 

> Such is the nature of bold design — risks don’t always pan out as you hope, but with each iteration, the solution comes closer within reach.

Talk about Argyle, Sonus

Iteration is the key afterwards. This goes with low-fidelity prototyping.
