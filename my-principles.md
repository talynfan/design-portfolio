# My Design Principles

_What's important to me as a designer?_

When I started designing for the first time in Fall 2021, I wasn't sure how much I would enjoy it or how good I'd be. It felt so different from my other experience in creative writing, computer science, and theater. Contrary to my initial worries, I have carried my skills and instincts from these other parts of my life into design. I approach interface design with the same core principles that I use in my other identities as an artist and coder.

## 1. Storytelling

A user's experience is like a crafted story. I like thinking about the psychology of my audience: where people will look first, what will stay in their minds after the experience. As a writer, I am versed in guiding a linear narrative and storytelling. Specifically, my work in live theater (primarily as a playwright and actor) has cultivated a constant awareness of a literal live audience's state-of-mind.

My playwriting professor once told me that "a play happens in the audience, not onstage." Likewise, **an interface's true work happens in the user's mind, not in the literal technology the user may be holding or touching.**

As I design, I keep in mind the "story" of the user's experience, from start to finish. Usability studies, where a test user walks through a prototype and speaks aloud their thought processes, are very helpful in my understanding of a user's psychology. I want the users or audience to feel engaged throughout the entire experience I have crafted. I also try to minimize confusion by prioritizing simplicity and discoverability.

**Similar to how I would outline the plot of a short story, I also outline the user's experience in a flowchart or other visual representation.**

When I worked on the conversational chatbot Argyle, I created a mostly linear conversation flow that could also branch based on user responses. Each response clearly linked to a personalized reply from Argyle, either immediately, or at the end of the conversation when Argyle summarized the results of the interaction.

I also worked with a team to create a flowchart for a Figma prototype of a redesigned Fox Theater mobile site.

A well-crafted design will both allow the user to intuitively complete specific linear tasks, while also being flexible enough for them to make their own personalized "stories" based on what is most important to them.

## Joy

Enjoyment is very important to me. A product should be fun to use, beyond its utility value. Creativity and innovation is what makes humans superior over algorithms.

Include Argyle and video game design. Sarcastic personality really shines

Choice of Argyle name instead of bot

I imitated the way real people my age type to make things a little playful and add a hint of excitement.

## Organization

I keep organized in my design process and take good notes of all iterations, from start to finish. In a team, I am typically the person to "take minutes" of what is accomplished each meeting or day.

## Low-fidelity prototyping

I love to sketch. Drawing and doodling helps me quickly understand what a technology will look like before it is even built. It is important to communicate the essence of an idea without needing it to function.

## Risk-taking

Not all of the things I do work.

Talk about Argyle, Sonus

Iteration is the key afterwards. This goes with low-fidelity prototyping.
