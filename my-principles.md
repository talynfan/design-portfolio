# My Design Principles

_What's important to me as a designer?_

When I started designing for the first time in Fall 2021, I wasn't sure how much I would enjoy it or how good I'd be. It felt so different from my prior experience in creative writing, computer science, and theater. As I soon discovered, though, my skills and instincts from these other parts of my life are transferrable to my design process. I approach interface design with the same core principles that I use in my other identities as an artist and coder.

## Storytelling

A user's experience is like a crafted story. I like thinking about the psychology of my audience: where people will look first, what will stay in their minds after the experience. As a writer, I am versed in guiding a linear narrative and storytelling. Specifically, my work in live theater (primarily as a playwright and actor) has cultivated a constant awareness of a literal live audience's state-of-mind.

My playwriting professor once told me that "a play happens in the audience, not onstage." Likewise, **an interface's true work happens in the user's mind, not in the literal technology the user may be holding or touching.**

As I design, I keep in mind the "story" of the user's experience, from start to finish. Usability studies, where a test user walks through a prototype and speaks aloud their thought processes, are very helpful in my understanding of a user's psychology. I want the users or audience to feel engaged throughout the entire experience I have crafted. I also try to minimize confusion by prioritizing simplicity and discoverability.

**Similar to how I would outline the plot of a short story, I also outline the user's experience in a flowchart or other visual representation.**

When I worked on the conversational chatbot Argyle, I created a mostly linear conversation flow that could also branch based on user responses. Each response clearly linked to a personalized reply from Argyle, either immediately, or at the end of the conversation when Argyle summarized the results of the interaction.

I also worked with a team to create a flowchart for a Figma prototype of a redesigned Fox Theater mobile site. While more complicated than the Argyle flow, it is still easily navigable. The menu at the bottom helps the user find what they're looking for, while "back" buttons on almost all of the screens allow for quick and easy error correction.

When creating a demo video for a new product design for the Fox Theater, "Sonus", I had two choices. One idea was to simply film the physical prototype from multiple angles and describe its function. However, this would have been a stiff and uninspiring video, as our actual prototype was relatively unfunctional. 

So, I went with the second idea: illustrate a user story with made up characters in a scenario typical of when Sonus might be helpful. Present the problem (wanting to give live commentary in the theater), present the potential solution (Sonus), and illustrate how the solution solves the problem. A slogan in the title, "Live Theater, Live Commentary," further communicates the intent of the design in a catchy, succinct manner. By creating the demo video to be like a little movie with a story, it better communicates the design to the target audience so that their own minds fill in the gaps of the incomplete prototype.

I also consciously created a story-like experience with a visualization depicting video game statistics. By clicking through the interactive visualization from start to finish, reading the captions and engaging with the data, the user gains an understanding of how genre affects (or doesn't affect) the popularity of video games.

**In general, a well-crafted design will both allow the user to intuitively complete specific linear tasks, while also being flexible enough for them to make their own personalized "stories" based on what is most important to them.**

## Joy

In addition to a user's understanding of a product, their enjoyment is also very important. A good design should be fun to use, beyond its pure utility value.

Attention to joy and entertainment is most evident in my video game visualization. As my team browsed the CSV data, we got caught up playing “I spy” with titles that we recognized or had played. We wanted to bring this joyful experience of discovery to a wider audience with our visualizations.

Our team used our prior knowledge of video games, plus a little bit of research, to create “fun facts” about each of the genres. We spent some time exploring the visualization ourselves and noted what we found interesting or peculiar. The captions for each genre’s slide were written to be informational and entertaining, and also prompt exploration of the data. We hoped that users could have fun hunting for game titles they might recognize, either from our prompts or from their own curiosity.

Below are a few of the slides with captions based on my own personal knowledge and experience with these games. I injected the "facts" with my clearly biased opinions to add some sarcastic humor to the visualization.

When choosing the name for my conversational chatbot, I suggested the name "Argyle" instead of a more robotic name like 
“Movebot” (or anything with “bot” at the end). “Argyle” was anthropomorphic but also a little abstract (like an argyle vest). They/He/It sounded like a casual friend who would be knowledgeable, kind, and trustworthy, but also not afraid to be blunt when necessary. The more human name and personality would help users feel more comfortable interacting with it and enjoy the whimsy of having a digital "friend" to talk to.

I wrote Argyle's dialogue to have some personality to add flavor to its function. For example, At the end of the conversation flow with Argyle, the bot returns a summary of the user's sentiments on the discussed potential city of residence. Instead of a bland message:

> Click next for results

I instead imitated the way real people of college age type. The new message is a little playful and adds a hint of excitement:

> Aaaaand that's all the questions I have. Ready for your results?

**As a designer, it is my responsibility and pleasure to use my creativity and innovation to create fun designs.**

## Organization

This is a principle that is highly stressed in my life as a programmer. Your code has to contain comments so that another programmer, or your future self, can easily parse through your algorithms to replicate or improve them. "Version Control" is important for large projects (especially collaborative ones) so that, even when you implement major changes to a program, you can still recover and analyze prior versions.

Documentation of the design process is somewhat like version control. **I keep organized in my design process and take good notes of all iterations, from start to finish.** When working in a design team, I am typically the person to "take minutes" of what is accomplished each meeting or day.

When I was working with a team on the Fox Theater mobile site redesign project, I made just these kinds of notes.

<img src="pics/fox process document.png" alt="Design log for Fox Theater website redesign" width="600"/>

I ensured that photos were taken of each Sonus mask iteration as we experimented with different ways of attaching the mask to the face, or attaching those attachments to the mask. This was important to mark our progress, especially because the creation of a new prototype sometimes required the mutilation of a prior iteration to salvage materials.

<img src="pics/sonus draft 1.jpg" alt="First draft of sonus mask" width="600"/>

Aside from documentation, I also prioritized organization in the design process itself. Argyle the chatbot had a very long conversational flow, so it was important to keep all of the questions and answers in the proper order. To maintain order, and also make my intended conversation flow more intuitive to my teammates who would implement the bot, I created a robust spreadsheet system with consistent "tags" for each question category.

**Even though cutting corners may save time in the short term, staying organized in the design process ultimately improves teamwork and workflow.**

## Low-fidelity prototyping

Even though I don't skimp on keeping my designs organized, **I still save time by sketching out my designs on paper.** Drawing and doodling helps me quickly understand what a technology will look like or is capable of before it is even built. I use messy sketches to brainstorm, and I draw with more effort to create testable, low-fidelity prototypes.

When my team first imagined the Sonus mask, our initial idea looked significantly different from the final product. Most notably, it had goggles with augmented reality. Before we began building our prototype, I sketched out a few ideas of what it would look like. This helped us realize that the AR goggles were too lofty a goal to be included in our product in our short work window.

<img src="pics/sonus brainstorming.png" alt="Sketching ideas for Sonus product" width="600"/>

When creating the storyboard for the Sonus demo video, I drew each frame out on paper. I drew stick figures to save time, but still gave them distinguishing features and details where necessary for clarity. By being efficient with my time spent drawing, I was able to put more time into devising the script, editing the video, and working on the physical mask itself.

<img src="pics/sonus storyboard.png" alt="Storyboard for Sonus product" width="600"/>

I also sketched out the interface and visualizations of the video game dataset on paper. This sketch is sheet 5, the "final design", of the [5 design sheet methodology](http://fds.design/index.php/resources-and-publications/). **These drawings can communicate the essence of an idea without needing it to actually function.**

<img src="pics/vg sketch.jpg" alt="Sketches of the video game visualization" width="600"/>

For the Fox Theater mobile site redesign, the design spent almost all of its life in different forms of sketches.  I designed these particular screens for the calendar and list views of the event schedule. Because it was on a whiteboard, my team and I were able to easily discuss the design and make changes until we were satisfied.

<img src="pics/whiteboard fox calendar.jpg" alt="Whiteboard sketches for Fox Theater mobile events calendar" width="600"/>

We then created all of the screens for the mobile site manually on paper and cut them into phone-sized screens in order to test with users.

After evaluating the paper screens with user testing, we moved on to remake them as medium fidelity mock-ups in Figma. (Note: the color scheme was later revised to be darker and easier to view.) This last, digital prototype was made possible by its low-fidelity paper predecessors.

In summary, **low-fidelity sketching is my prototyping medium of choice because it allows for rapid iteration and efficiency of effort.**

## Risk-taking

Not all of the things I do work. 

Problems with Sonus mask

<img src="pics/sonus final.jpg" alt="Final iteration of Sonus mask" width="600"/>

**Such is the nature of bold design — risks don’t always pan out as you hope, but with each iteration, the solution comes closer within reach.**

Talk about Argyle, Sonus

Iteration is the key afterwards. This goes with low-fidelity prototyping.
